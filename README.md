# ST3215 / STS3215 Python Module
Python module that enables easy communication with Waveshare ST3215 servos.
It is based on examples provided by Waveshare and an existing module found here: https://github.com/Mickael-Roger/python-st3215

This module supports synchronised reading & writing, which causes less overhead and enables actions to be triggered at the same time on all servos.
